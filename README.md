# Rainfall Artistic Visualization Project

This project transforms daily rainfall data from Cheung Chau into both informative and artistic visualizations using Python and matplotlib.

## Features
- **Animated Rainfall Drops:** Circles represent daily rainfall, with size and color mapped to rainfall amount.
- **Rainfall Wave Animation:** Sine wave amplitude and color reflect rainfall, creating a vibrant, evolving pattern.
- **Rain Streaks & Drops:** Combination of vertical streaks and drops, with optimized performance and fullscreen display.
- **Standard Line Chart:** Simple, clear plot of daily rainfall for reference.

## Files
- `animated_rainfall.py`: Animated rainfall drops visualization.
- `normal_rainfall_diagram.py`: Standard line chart of daily rainfall.
- `rainfall_wave_animation.py`: Artistic sine wave animation.
- `rainfall_streaks_and_drops.py`: Combined streaks and drops animation.
- `rainfall_streaks_and_drops_optimized.py`: Optimized fullscreen streaks and drops animation.
- `daily_CCH_RF_ALL.csv`: Source rainfall data (Cheung Chau).

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
   ```
2. Run any script in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python animated_rainfall.py
   # or
   python rainfall_streaks_and_drops_optimized.py
   ```

## Data Source
- The CSV file contains daily rainfall records for Cheung Chau, with columns for year, month, day, and rainfall value.

## Customization
- You can adjust colors, animation speed, and styles in each script to suit your artistic vision.
